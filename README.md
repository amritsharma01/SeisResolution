# Seismic Image Denoising and Resolution Enhancement (In Progress)

## Overview
This project aims to denoise and enhance the resolution of seismic images using advanced image processing techniques. By improving the quality of seismic images, we ensure better geological insights and more accurate data interpretation.

## Features
- **Denoising Seismic Images**: Removes unwanted noise from seismic data using advanced filtering and processing methods.
- **Resolution Enhancement**: Upscales low-resolution seismic images to ensure more precise interpretation of geological structures.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Utilizes a U-Net model with added subpixel and ResNet layers for superior denoising and resolution enhancement.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, TensorFlow
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook

## Implementation
1. **U-Net Model**: 
   - Designed with added subpixel layers for resolution enhancement.
   - Integrated ResNet layers to improve the model's denoising capabilities.
2. **Image Processing with OpenCV**: 
   - Applied various filters to remove noise effectively.
   - Enhanced seismic image quality through preprocessing techniques.
3. **Resolution Upscaling**:
   - Developed a pipeline to upscale low-resolution images, ensuring they are usable for geological interpretation.

## Progress
The project is currently in development. Key functionalities, such as U-Net model training and OpenCV-based preprocessing, are being tested and fine-tuned.

## Future Scope
- Explore advanced generative models for further improvement.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for seismic image processing.
- Integrate real-world seismic datasets for validation.
